    "question": "How did you handle the stress/workload of your boot camp?",
    "answer": "Changing careers in my 30s was definitely a challenge, and came with a lot of imposter syndrome and anxiety. I worried that my previous experience wouldn’t translate or would be discounted, and that I’d be starting over from scratch. I also spent many nights worried I just wasn’t cut out for such a technical career. For me, having a support system was vital to getting through those feelings. I leaned on the teaching and support staff at my boot camp, my classmates, friends and family, and supporters in my local tech network and on Twitter. I sought out stories from other career-switchers or those without computer science backgrounds in tech to remind myself it was possible. I can’t stress enough how meaningful those stories were for me, which is why I wanted to share mine as well now that I’m on this side of it.",

    "question": "How can I get involved with speaking?",
    "answer": "Just ask! Many local and online meetups are in need of more speakers, and quite a few also provide mentorship to help if it's your first time. Check out the Women Who Code Front End track, we are looking for webinar speakers on a rolling basis, and it's where I gave my very first tech webinar.",
