    "question": "What's your story?",
    "answer": "It's a long one, so here are the highlights: I got my B.A. in Public Communications and became a journalist, moved to finance, got my MBA, and worked at companies like TD Ameritrade and Fidelity Investments, got bored of that, went to a coding bootcamp, did a LOT of networking, and now I'm on a mission to empower developer confidence by improving the software testing experience. I am passionate about supporting underrepresented people in tech and love teaching (I get that from my mom, but she works with second graders and has a MUCH harder job). Right now I spend a lot of time learning, working on projects, and trying to write and stream about tech when I can. For the long story, check me out on LinkedIn.",

    "question": "How did you handle the stress/workload of your boot camp?",
    "answer": "Changing careers in my 30s was definitely a challenge, and came with a lot of imposter syndrome and anxiety. I worried that my previous experience wouldnâ€™t translate or would be discounted, and that Iâ€™d be starting over from scratch. I also spent many nights worried I just wasnâ€™t cut out for such a technical career. For me, having a support system was vital to getting through those feelings. I leaned on the teaching and support staff at my boot camp, my classmates, friends and family, and supporters in my local tech network and on Twitter. I sought out stories from other career-switchers or those without computer science backgrounds in tech to remind myself it was possible. I canâ€™t stress enough how meaningful those stories were for me, which is why I wanted to share mine as well now that Iâ€™m on this side of it.",

    "question": "How can I get involved with speaking?",
    "answer": "Just ask! Many local and online meetups are in need of more speakers, and quite a few also provide mentorship to help if it's your first time. Check out the Women Who Code Front End track, we are looking for webinar speakers on a rolling basis, and it's where I gave my very first tech webinar.",

    "question": "Can you give me feedback on my project/resume/portfolio?",
    "answer": "Unfortunately I don't have the capacity to offer individual reviews, and I hate over-promising and not being able to deliver ðŸ˜ž I recommend checking out networks like Women Who Code if you are looking for career advice. There are a lot of amazing resources out there. You can also check out my talk on what I learned before getting my first job in tech.",
